This project is all about the data cleaning and EDA to enhance the insights

In summary, the data analysis conducted in this notebook has provided several insights into students' preferences for universities in the year 2013:

Students tend to apply to universities with a higher number of applications, but this doesn't necessarily mean they prefer those universities. The enrollment rate varies, and some universities with lower application numbers have higher enrollment rates.

Acceptance rates do not strongly influence students' preferences, as there is no clear pattern between acceptance rates and enrollment rates. However, private universities with low acceptance rates tend to maintain relatively high enrollment rates.

Public universities receive a higher number of applications on average compared to private universities, and there is less variation in application numbers among public universities.

Students do prefer public universities, as public universities tend to have higher enrollment rates compared to private universities.

Affordability in terms of tuition and fees plays a significant role in students' preferences. Universities with lower tuition costs tend to receive more applications and have higher enrollment rates.
